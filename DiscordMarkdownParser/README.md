# DiscordMarkdownParser

Fork of [SwiftMarkdownParser](https://github.com/sciasxp/SwiftMarkdownParser) modified to parse Discord flavoured markdown.

Lotta stuff deleted, namely all the syntax engines and syntax parsing, related protocols and all renderers. There is only the modified parser and additional AST elements.

Thanks to the contributors of the original project!
